                Akira is a 1988 Japanese animated post-apocalyptic science fiction film directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, produced by Ryōhei Suzuki
                and Shunzō Katō, and written by Otomo and Izo Hashimoto, based on Otomo's manga of the same name. The film
                had a production budget of $10 million, making it the most expensive anime film of its time.

                Set in a dystopian 2019, Akira tells the story of Shōtarō Kaneda, a leader of a local biker gang whose childhood friend,
                Tetsuo Shima, acquires incredible telekinetic abilities after a motorcycle accident, eventually threatening
                an entire military complex amidst chaos and rebellion in the sprawling futuristic metropolis of Neo-Tokyo.
                While most of the character designs and settings were adapted from the manga, the plot differs considerably
                and removes much of the last half of the manga.

                Akira was released on 16 July 1988 by Toho. It garnered an international cult following since its theatrical release, and
                went on to gross over $80 million worldwide from its theatrical and VHS releases. It is widely considered
                by many critics to be one of the greatest animated and science fiction films of all time, as well as a landmark
                in Japanese animation. The film had a significant impact on popular culture worldwide, paving the way for
                the growth of anime and Japanese popular culture in the Western world as well as influencing numerous works
                in animation, comics, film, music, television and video games.
